IPL Matches Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

What is EDA? Why do we do EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies,to test hypotheses and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

Exploratory Data Analysis involves two fundamental steps:-

● Data Analysis (Data Pre processing, Cleaning and Manipulation).

● Data Visualisation (Visualize relationships in data using different types of plots).

IPL Dataset Information

Indian Premier League(IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India(BCCI) in 2008. The dataset that is going to be used is 'IPL Matches Dataset'. It contains IPL matches data from 2008 to 2019,we are going to clean the data if required and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The tools that are going to be used for the EDA would be numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

Data Analysis Libraries

Pandas is the most commonly used library for data analysis in python. There are tons of libraries available in python for data visualization and among them, matplotlib is the most commonly used. Matplotlib provides full control over the plot to make plot customisation easy, but what it lacks is built-in support for pandas. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas.
